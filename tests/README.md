# Planetmint Server Unit Tests

Most of the tests in the `tests/` folder are unit tests. For info about how to write and run tests, see [the docs about contributing to Planetmint](http://docs.planetmint.io/en/latest/index.html), especially:

- [Write Code - Remember to Write Tests](https://docs.planetmint.io/en/latest/contributing/dev-setup-coding-and-contribution-process/write-code.html?highlight=write%20code#remember-to-write-tests)
- [Notes on Running a Local Dev Node with Docker Compose](https://docs.planetmint.io/en/latest/contributing/dev-setup-coding-and-contribution-process/run-node-with-docker compose.html), especially `make test`
- [

Note: There are acceptance tests in the `acceptance/` folder (at the same level in the hierarchy as the `tests/` folder).
