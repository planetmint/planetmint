# Planetmint

Meet Planetmint. The metadata blockchain.

It has some database characteristics and some blockchain `properties <properties.html>`_,
including decentralization, immutability and native support for assets.

At a high level, one can communicate with a Planetmint network (set of nodes) using the Planetmint HTTP API, or a wrapper for that API, such as the Planetmint Python Driver. Each Planetmint node runs Planetmint Server and various other software. The `terminology page <terminology.html>`_ explains some of those terms in more detail.
