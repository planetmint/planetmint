# Write a Planetmint Refinement Proposal (PRP)

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, and you want some feedback before you write a full Planetmint Refinement Proposal (PRP), then feel free to:
  - ask in the [planetmint/community Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/planetmint/planetmint) or
  - [open a new issue in the planetmint/PRPs repo](https://github.com/planetmint/PRPs/issues/new) and give it the label **PRP idea**.

If you want to discuss an existing PRP, then [open a new issue in the planetmint/PRPs repo](https://github.com/planetmint/PRPs/issues/new) and give it the label **discuss existing PRP**.

## Steps to Write a New PRP

1. Look at the structure of existing PRPs in the [planetmint/PRPs repo](https://github.com/planetmint/PRPs). Note the section headings. [PRP-2](https://github.com/planetmint/PRPs/tree/master/2) (our variant of the consensus-oriented specification system [COSS]) says more about the expected structure and process.
1. Write a first draft of your PRP. It doesn't have to be long or perfect.
1. Push your BEP draft to the [planetmint/PRPs repo](https://github.com/planetmint/PRPs) and make a pull request. [PRP-1](https://github.com/planetmint/PRPs/tree/master/1) (our variant of C4) outlines the process we use to handle all pull requests. In particular, we try to merge all pull requests quickly.
1. Your PRP can be revised by pushing more pull requests.
