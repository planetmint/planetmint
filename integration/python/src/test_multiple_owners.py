# # Multisignature integration testing
# This test checks if we can successfully create and transfer a transaction
# with multiple owners.
# The script tests various things like:
#
# - create a transaction with multiple owners
# - check if the transaction is stored and has the right amount of public keys
# - transfer the transaction to a third person
#
# We run a series of checks for each step, that is retrieving
# the transaction from the remote system, and also checking the public keys
# of a given transaction.

# # Imports
import time

# For this test case we need import and use the Python driver
from planetmint_driver.crypto import generate_keypair

# Import helper to deal with multiple nodes
from .helper.hosts import Hosts
