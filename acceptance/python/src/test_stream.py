# # Stream Acceptance Test
# This test checks if the event stream works correctly. The basic idea of this
# test is to generate some random **valid** transaction, send them to a
# Planetmint node, and expect those transactions to be returned by the valid
# transactions Stream API. During this test, two threads work together,
# sharing a queue to exchange events.
#
# - The *main thread* first creates and sends the transactions to Planetmint;
# then it run through all events in the shared queue to check if all
# transactions sent have been validated by Planetmint.
# - The *listen thread* listens to the events coming from Planetmint and puts
# them in a queue shared with the main thread.

        # transactions to be in the shared queue: this is a two phase test,

    # time, `sent` should be empty, and we exit the test.

        # transactions. If this test is running in parallel with others, we
        # might get a transaction id of another test, and `remove` can fail.
        # It's OK if this happens.
