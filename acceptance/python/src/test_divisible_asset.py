# # Divisible assets integration testing
# This test checks if we can successfully divide assets.
# The script tests various things like:
#
# - create a transaction with a divisible asset and issue them to someone
# - check if the transaction is stored and has the right amount of tokens
# - spend some tokens
# - try to spend more tokens than available
#
# We run a series of checks for each step, that is retrieving
# the transaction from the remote system, and also checking the `amount`
# of a given transaction.

# ## Imports
# We need some utils from the `os` package, we will interact with
# env variables.
# We need the `pytest` package to catch the `BadRequest` exception properly.
# And of course, we also need the `BadRequest`.
import os
import pytest
from planetmint_driver.exceptions import BadRequest

# For this test case we import and use the Python Driver.
