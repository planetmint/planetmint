# # Basic Acceptance Test
# Here we check that the primitives of the system behave as expected.
# As you will see, this script tests basic stuff like:
#
# - create a transaction
# - check if the transaction is stored
# - check for the outputs of a given public key
# - transfer the transaction to another key
#
# We run a series of checks for each steps, that is retrieving the transaction from
# the remote system, and also checking the `outputs` of a given public key.

# ## Imports
# We need some utils from the `os` package, we will interact with
# env variables.
import os

# For this test case we import and use the Python Driver.
from planetmint_driver import Planetmint
from planetmint_driver.crypto import generate_keypair

def test_basic():
    # ## Set up a connection to Planetmint
    # To use BighainDB we need a connection. Here we create one. By default we
    # connect to localhost, but you can override this value using the env variable
    # called `PLANETMINT_ENDPOINT`, a valid value must include the schema:
    # `https://example.com:9984`
    bdb = Planetmint(os.environ.get("PLANETMINT_ENDPOINT"))

    # ## Create keypairs
    # This test requires the interaction between two actors with their own keypair.
    # The two keypairs will be called—drum roll—Alice and Bob.
