            Note:
                Different cases for threshold conditions:

                Combining multiple `inputs` with an arbitrary number of
                `recipients` can yield interesting cases for the creation of
                threshold conditions we'd like to support. The following
                notation is proposed:

                1. The index of a `recipient` corresponds to the index of
                   an input:
                   e.g. `transfer([input1], [a])`, means `input1` would now be
                        owned by user `a`.

                2. `recipients` can (almost) get arbitrary deeply nested,
                   creating various complex threshold conditions:
                   e.g. `transfer([inp1, inp2], [[a, [b, c]], d])`, means
                        `a`'s signature would have a 50% weight on `inp1`
                        compared to `b` and `c` that share 25% of the leftover
                        weight respectively. `inp2` is owned completely by `d`.

            Args:
                inputs (:obj:`list` of :class:`~planetmint.common.transaction.
                    Input`): Converted `Output`s, intended to
                    be used as inputs in the transfer to generate.
                recipients (:obj:`list` of :obj:`tuple`): A list of
                    ([keys],amount) that represent the recipients of this
                    Transaction.
                asset_id (str): The asset ID of the asset to be transferred in
                    this Transaction.
                metadata (dict): Python dictionary to be stored along with the
                    Transaction.

            Returns:
                :class:`~planetmint.common.transaction.Transaction`
